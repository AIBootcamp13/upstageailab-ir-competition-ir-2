- **[Embedding Profiles](../docs/EMBEDDING_PROFILES_INDEXES.md)** - Available models and configurations
- **[CLI Tool README](../docs/CLI_TOOL_README.md)** - Command-line interface documentation

## Folder Structure

- `assistant-instructions/` - Instructions and guidelines for AI coding assistants
- `context/` - Context documents and guidance for AI contributors

## Purpose

These documents help AI assistants understand:
- Project architecture and patterns
- Development workflows and best practices
- Data structures and indexing conventions
- Critical workflows and common pitfalls
- Complete AI agent ecosystem and capabilities

## Essential Reading for AI Agents

### 1. Quick Start
- Read **[AI Agents Quick Reference](../docs/AI_AGENTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** for immediate access to commands
- Check current profile: `uv run python scripts/cli.py config show`
- Verify services: `services-status`

### 2. Complete Usage
- Study **[AI Agents Usage Guide](../docs/AI_AGENTS_USAGE_GUIDE.md)** for comprehensive understanding
- Learn available profiles and their use cases
- Understand fine-tuning procedures

### 3. API Integration
- Use **[AI Agents API Reference](../docs/AI_AGENTS_API_REFERENCE.md)** for programmatic access
- Learn Python API classes and methods
- Understand REST API endpoints

## Usage

AI assistants should read these documents to:
1. Understand the project's modular architecture
2. Follow established development patterns
3. Use correct workflows for common tasks
4. Avoid common pitfalls and wasted work
5. Leverage the full AI agent ecosystem effectively

## Files

### Assistant Instructions
- `copilot-instructions.md` - Comprehensive coding assistant guidelines
- `data-context.md` - Data structure and indexing guidance

### Context Documents
- Additional context files as needed for specific AI tools or workflows

## Maintenance

When adding new AI-specific documentation:
1. Place in appropriate subfolder based on content type
2. Update this README with new file descriptions
3. Ensure cross-references are updated if files are moved
4. Update the main documentation files as needed

## Note

This folder is intended for AI use only. Human contributors should refer to the main project documentation in the root `README.md` and `docs/` folder.
