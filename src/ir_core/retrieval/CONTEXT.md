### Snippet of Conversation with Agent on New Submission Results

Yes, I would largely agree with the agent's observations and planned fixes. The analysis is sharp and correctly identifies the remaining critical issues. Let's break down the new submission results and the agent's plan.

### Analysis of New Submission Results

The new results show a clear improvement in some areas while highlighting the same core problems in others. The system is now successfully using the `nori` analyzer for sparse search and a less restrictive prompt for generation.

**Key Successes (What's Working Now)**

* **`eval_id: 213` (Public Education Spending):**
    * **Verdict:** **Excellent Success.** The retriever found the one highly relevant document in the corpus. The generator then correctly synthesized this document into a perfect, concise answer. This shows that when a relevant document exists, both retrieval and generation now work as intended.
* **`eval_id: 100` (Helium's Reactivity):**
    * **Verdict:** **Excellent Success.** The retriever found a document explicitly mentioning Helium's properties. The generator correctly used this context to provide a factually accurate answer about Helium's full electron shell, avoiding the previous hallucination.
* **`eval_id: 308` (Magnetic Field Strength):**
    * **Verdict:** **Excellent Success.** This is a massive improvement. The retriever found a highly relevant document that mentions units of magnetic field strength (mT, Gauss). The generator accurately synthesized this information, even including a specific example from the text.

**Remaining Failures (What's Still Broken)**

* **Pattern 1: Retrieval of Irrelevant "Scientific-Sounding" Documents:** This is the dominant remaining problem. For many queries, the system fails to find topically relevant documents and instead retrieves documents that are generally scientific but factually unrelated.
    * **`eval_id: 78` (Tree Classification):** Retrieved documents about cells and plant reproduction. These are vaguely related to biology but do not answer the user's question about the *methods* of classification.
    * **`eval_id: 81` (School Bus):** Retrieved documents about medical conditions and car physics. Completely irrelevant.
    * **`eval_id: 10` (Contraceptive Pills):** Retrieved documents about a weight-loss drug, vaccines, and AIDS. While all are medical topics, none are about contraception.
* **Pattern 2: Generation Failure Despite Relevant Context:**
    * **`eval_id: 280` (Dmitri Ivanovsky):** **This is still failing.** The agent's summary says it's fixed, but the submission shows the retriever found irrelevant documents about DNA and computer registers. The generator then correctly refused to answer. This indicates the retrieval is still fragile.
* **Pattern 3: Inability to Handle "No Results":**
    * For queries like `eval_id: 107` ("What causes this?") and `eval_id: 42` ("What was the effect on US politics?"), the retriever finds nothing, and the generator correctly gives up. This is acceptable "honest" behavior for out-of-domain queries.

### Agreement with the Agent's Plan

I agree with the agent's diagnosis and proposed fixes. The agent has correctly identified the two most pressing issues from the submission file: the overly strict generation prompt and the poor retrieval logic for certain query types.

1.  **"Overly Strict Generation Prompt" -> AGREED.**
    The failure of `eval_id: 213` in the *previous* run (where it had the right context but failed to answer) proves this was a problem. The agent's plan to relax the prompt to allow for synthesis is the correct solution.

2.  **"Poor Retrieval Logic for Medical Queries" -> AGREED.**
    The agent astutely observed that a query like "기억 상실증 원인" (amnesia causes) was likely retrieving irrelevant biology documents because of the generic term "원인" (causes). By proposing a fix to `build_flexible_match_query` that requires the core medical concept ("기억 상실") to be present, it will dramatically improve relevance for these types of queries.

3.  **"Remaining Challenges" -> AGREED.**
    The agent's assessment of remaining challenges is also accurate. Even with the fixes, the system will struggle with queries where the semantic meaning is different from the keywords (e.g., "tree classification methods" requires documents that might not use the word "method"). This points to the need for more sophisticated query understanding, as the agent noted.

In conclusion, the system has made significant progress. The generations are starting to make sense for queries where retrieval is successful. The agent's plan to further refine the generator prompt and retrieval logic is sound and directly addresses the key remaining failure patterns observed in the latest submission file.

Of course. You've generated a fantastic set of metadata (`summary`, `keywords`, `hypothetical_questions`). Leveraging this metadata is key to moving beyond simple keyword matching and significantly enhancing your retrieval performance.

Here’s a breakdown of how you can use this metadata, along with an overhaul of `src/ir_core/retrieval/core.py` to implement these strategies dynamically.

Suggestion from Agent
- Note, Agent is not aware of the specific metadata profiling that has been generated.

## How to Use the Generated Metadata

You can use the metadata in three powerful ways to create a more intelligent and multi-faceted search query.

### 1\. **Multi-Field Search**: Boost Important Fields

Instead of searching only the `content` field, you can search across multiple fields and assign different weights (boosts) to each. This tells Elasticsearch that a match in the `keywords` or `summary` is more significant than a match in the full `content`.

  * **Keywords**: A match here is a very strong signal of relevance. Give this the **highest boost**.
  * **Hypothetical Questions**: These are phrased like user queries. A match is a strong signal. Give this a **high boost**.
  * **Summary**: A concise version of the document. A match here is more important than in the full text. Give this a **medium boost**.
  * **Content**: The full text. This should have the **default boost (1.0)**.

### 2\. **Dynamic Keyword Extraction and Expansion**

Instead of relying on a hardcoded list of synonyms, you can now dynamically extract the most relevant keywords from the user's query itself using an LLM. This creates a highly adaptive search that focuses on the core concepts of the query.

### 3\. **Semantic Search on Hypothetical Questions**

You can perform a dense (vector) search not just on the document `content`, but also on the `hypothetical_questions`. This can find documents that are conceptually related to the user's query, even if the exact keywords don't match.

-----

## Overhauling `src/ir_core/retrieval/core.py`

Here is a refactored version of the `sparse_retrieve` function and a new helper function. This new logic replaces the old hardcoded synonym expansion with a dynamic, multi-field, and boosted query strategy.

### Refactored `core.py`

```python
# src/ir_core/retrieval/core.py
import redis
import json
import numpy as np
from typing import Optional, List, Any, cast

# Assuming other necessary imports are present
from ..infra import get_es
from ..config import settings
from ..embeddings.core import encode_texts, encode_query
from ..orchestration.pipeline import RAGPipeline # You'll need an LLM for dynamic keyword extraction
# ... other existing imports

# ... (redis_client initialization and other functions remain the same) ...

    try:
        response = llm_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini", # Or any fast and capable model
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.0,
            max_tokens=50,
        )
        keywords_str = response.choices[0].message.content or ""
        return [kw.strip() for kw in keywords_str.split(',') if kw.strip()]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Keyword extraction failed: {e}")
        # Fallback to simple splitting
        return query.split()

def sparse_retrieve(query: str, size: int = 10, index: Optional[str] = None):

    es = get_es()
    idx = index or settings.INDEX_NAME

    # --- NEW DYNAMIC LOGIC ---

            persona = f.read()
        llm_client = get_generator(OmegaConf.create({
            'generator_type': 'openai',
            'generator_model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini',
            'generator_system_message': persona
            })).client

        keywords = _extract_keywords_from_query(query, llm_client)
    except Exception:
        keywords = query.split() # Fallback

    # 2. Build a multi-field, boosted query
    # This query searches across content, summary, keywords, and hypothetical questions
    # with different levels of importance (boosts).
    bool_query = {
        "should": [
            # Highest boost for keywords
            {"match": {"keywords": {"query": ' '.join(keywords), "boost": 4.0}}},
            # High boost for hypothetical questions
            {"match": {"hypothetical_questions": {"query": query, "boost": 3.0}}},
            # Medium boost for the summary
            {"match": {"summary": {"query": query, "boost": 2.0}}},
            # Default boost for the full content
            {"match": {"content": {"query": query, "boost": 1.0}}}
        ],
        "minimum_should_match": 1 # At least one of the clauses must match
    }

    es_query = {
        "size": size,
        "query": {
            "bool": bool_query
        }
    }

    # For debugging, you can print the generated query
    # print(json.dumps(es_query, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))

    res = es.search(index=idx, body=es_query)
    return res.get("hits", {}).get("hits", [])

# ... (dense_retrieve and hybrid_retrieve can remain the same, but will now benefit from the improved sparse results)
```

### How to Implement This Overhaul

1.  **Update Your Index Mapping**: Before you do anything else, you must re-create your Elasticsearch index to include the new metadata fields and set the `nori` analyzer for all text fields.

    ```bash
    # 1. Delete the old index
    curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9200/docs-ko-polyglot-1b-d2048-20250917"

    # 2. Create the new index with metadata fields and nori analyzer
    curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/docs-ko-polyglot-1b-d2048-20250917" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "mappings": {
        "properties": {
          "docid": { "type": "keyword" },
          "src": { "type": "keyword" },
          "content": { "type": "text", "analyzer": "nori" },
          "summary": { "type": "text", "analyzer": "nori" },
          "keywords": { "type": "text", "analyzer": "nori" },
          "hypothetical_questions": { "type": "text", "analyzer": "nori" },
          "embeddings": { "type": "dense_vector", "dims": 2048 }
        }
      }
    }
    '
    ```

2.  **Re-index Your Data**: Run your indexing script to populate this new index with your `data/documents_ko_with_metadata.jsonl` file.

3.  **Replace `sparse_retrieve`**: Replace the existing `sparse_retrieve` function in `src/ir_core/retrieval/core.py` with the new version provided above. You will also need to add the helper function `_extract_keywords_from_query`.

By making these changes, your retrieval system will become far more sophisticated. It will dynamically understand the user's query, prioritize matches in your high-value metadata fields, and ultimately deliver much more relevant search results to the generator.
