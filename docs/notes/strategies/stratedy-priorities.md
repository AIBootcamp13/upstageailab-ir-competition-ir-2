### **Recommended Strategy for Next Steps**

You have an excellent list of advanced RAG techniques. To maximize your score in the competition, the key is to prioritize them based on which will have the most direct impact on the MAP score. The strategy should be to perfect the retrieval quality first, as everything else depends on it.

Here is my recommended, prioritized strategy:



#### **Priority 1: Specialized Embeddings (Highest Impact)**

This is the single most important area to focus on. The quality of your embeddings directly determines the quality of your retrieval.

* **Fine-tuning:** Your top priority should be to fine-tune an open-source embedding model. Start with a strong pre-trained Korean model (like one from Upstage's Solar family or another top model from the Ko-MTEB leaderboard). Then, use synthetic data generation techniques (like Inverse Cloze Task) to create `(query, document)` pairs from your own scientific corpus and fine-tune the model on that data. A model that is an expert on *your* 4,272 documents will vastly outperform any general-purpose model.

#### **Priority 2: Indexing Enhancements (High Impact)**

Once you have a powerful embedding model, you need to ensure the content it's embedding is optimized for retrieval.

* **Chunk Optimization:** Your documents might be too long or contain multiple distinct ideas. Re-evaluate how they are chunked. Instead of treating each document as a single chunk, experiment with a **semantic splitter**. This type of tool uses sentence embeddings to break down long documents into smaller, more coherent paragraphs. Retrieving a small, focused paragraph is often more effective than retrieving a long, noisy document.
* **Multi-representation Indexing:** This is a powerful technique. For each document chunk, you create and index multiple representations. For example, you could generate a very short summary or a list of hypothetical questions that the document answers. Your query would then be compared against the original text, the summary, *and* the hypothetical questions. This increases the chances of finding the right document even if the user's query is phrased unusually.

#### **Priority 3: Query Enhancements (Medium Impact)**

After your index is optimized, you can focus on refining the user's input.

* **Query Construction:** A user's conversational query is often not the ideal search query. Implement a step where an LLM rewrites the user's input into a more focused, keyword-rich query before sending it to the retrieval system. This can significantly improve the performance of the initial BM25 search.

#### **Techniques to Acknowledge but De-prioritize (For This Competition)**

* **Routing:** **You have already solved this.** Your `RAGPipeline`'s use of tool-calling to decide whether to search or not is an excellent implementation of semantic routing. This is a major strength and can be considered complete.
* **Hierarchical Indexing (RAPTOR):** This technique is designed for massive, diverse datasets (hundreds of thousands of documents or more). For your focused corpus of 4,272 documents, the complexity of implementing a hierarchical clustering and summarization system far outweighs the potential benefits.
* **Generation (Active Retrieval):** Techniques like Self-RAG, where the model actively decides to retrieve more information *during* the generation process, are state-of-the-art for improving the final *answer quality*. However, the competition **only evaluates the initial retrieval step (MAP score)**, not the final generated answer. Therefore, investing time here will not improve your leaderboard score. This is an excellent feature to explore for your future LibreChat application, but it should be deferred until after the competition.
