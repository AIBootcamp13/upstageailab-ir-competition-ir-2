Of course. After analyzing the provided examples, it's clear the queries are failing for a few common reasons: they are either too ambiguous (`eval_id: 107`, `81`), too indirect (`eval_id: 78`), or the retrieval system is failing to find a semantic match (`eval_id: 213`).

To make these queries more effective, you can employ several automated techniques before sending them to your retrieval system. Here are the most effective methods available.

***
## 1. Query Rewriting & Expansion (핵심어 추출 및 확장)

This is the most fundamental and often most effective technique. Instead of using the raw, conversational query, you use an LLM to extract the core concepts and expand them with synonyms or related terms.

* **How it Works:** The goal is to transform a natural language question into a keyword-style search query that is more likely to match documents in a vector database.

* **Application to your example (`eval_id: 78`):**
    * **Before:** `나무의 분류에 대해 조사해 보기 위한 방법은?` (What are the methods for researching the classification of trees?)
    * **Rewritten/Expanded Query for Search:** `나무 종류, 식물 분류학, 수목 분류 체계, tree taxonomy` (Tree types, plant taxonomy, tree classification systems, tree taxonomy). This query is far more direct and likely to match relevant documents.

## 2. Step-Back Prompting (단계별 재구성 프롬프트)

This technique is excellent for handling abstract or vague queries where the user's intent is unclear, like your "value of a school bus" example.

* **How it Works:** You use an LLM to take a "step back" from the specific query to find the underlying, more general concept. You then use this general concept to perform the search.

* **Application to your example (`eval_id: 81`):**
    * **Before:** `통학 버스의 가치에 대한 정보를 제공해 주세요.` (Please provide information about the value of a school bus.)
    * **Step-Back Process:**
        1.  **Prompt:** "What is the general, underlying concept being asked in the query 'What is the value of a school bus'?"
        2.  **LLM's Abstracted Concept:** "The user is asking about the socioeconomic impacts, safety benefits, and importance of student transportation systems."
        3.  **New Search Query:** `학생 교통수단의 사회적 이점, 통학 버스 안전성 및 경제적 효과` (Social benefits of student transport, school bus safety and economic effects). This completely avoids the unhelpful, literal interpretation of "value" that your system originally found.

## 3. Query Decomposition (질의 분해)

This is crucial for complex questions that ask for multiple pieces of information. You break the query into several simpler, independent sub-queries.

* **How it Works:** You run a retrieval for each sub-query and then synthesize the results to form a comprehensive final answer.

* **Example (using a more complex query):**
    * **Before:** `한국과 일본의 공교육 지출을 GDP 대비로 비교하고, 그 차이의 원인을 알려줘.` (Compare the public education spending of Korea and Japan as a ratio of GDP, and explain the reasons for the difference.)
    * **Decomposed Sub-queries:**
        1.  `한국 GDP 대비 공교육 지출 비율` (South Korea's public education spending to GDP ratio)
        2.  `일본 GDP 대비 공교육 지출 비율` (Japan's public education spending to GDP ratio)
        3.  `국가별 교육 예산 정책 차이` (Differences in national education budget policies)

***
## 4. Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)

This is a powerful but more advanced technique that works very well when queries are short and lack keywords, often leading to poor retrieval results.

* **How it Works:**
    1.  Take the original query.
    2.  Use an LLM to generate a detailed, hypothetical answer to that query.
    3.  **Use the embedding of this fake answer** to search your vector database. The logic is that the embedding of a detailed answer is semantically closer to the real source documents than the short, sparse query.

* **Application to your example (`eval_id: 213`):**
    * **Before:** `각 나라에서의 공교육 지출 상황에 대해 알려주십시오.` (Please tell me about the public education expenditure situation in various countries.)
    * **HyDE Process:**
        1.  **Generate Fake Answer:** An LLM might generate: *"OECD 국가들의 GDP 대비 공교육비 지출은 평균 5% 수준입니다. 북유럽 국가들은 6% 이상을 지출하며, 이는 교사 인건비, 학교 시설 유지 등에 사용됩니다..."* (Public education spending in OECD countries is around 5% of GDP on average. Nordic countries spend over 6%, which is used for teacher salaries, school facility maintenance...).
        2.  **Search:** Use the vector embedding of this entire generated paragraph for the search. This vector will be rich with relevant concepts ("OECD," "GDP," "teacher salaries"), leading to far more accurate document retrieval than the original short query.

## 5. Query Translation (질의 번역)

This is a simple but effective strategy, especially if your document corpus or embedding models are stronger in a specific language (like English).

* **How it Works:** Translate the query's core keywords into English. You can then either search in English only or search in both Korean and English and merge the results.

* **Application to your example (`eval_id: 78`):**
    * **Before:** `나무의 분류`
    * **Translated Keywords:** `tree classification`, `plant taxonomy`
    * This allows you to tap into a potentially larger and more scientifically rigorous pool of documents.

By implementing these techniques as a pre-processing step, you can significantly improve the quality and relevance of your retrieved documents, leading to much more accurate and helpful final answers.
