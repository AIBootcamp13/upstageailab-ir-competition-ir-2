### **Executive Summary**

Your intuition is correct: for a focused task like scientific QA, open-source models are not just "good enough," they are your **best path to winning the competition**. However, this comes with a crucial distinction between the embedding model (for retrieval) and the generation model (for tool-calling and answers).

* **For Embedding (Retrieval):** Open-source models can, and likely will, **outperform** your current baseline. This is where you should focus your efforts to directly increase your MAP score.
* **For Generation (Tool-Calling/Answering):** Open-source models can achieve high-quality results, but they present significant trade-offs in **reliability and speed**, especially for the critical tool-calling step.

Here is a detailed breakdown.

### **1. Assessment of Open-Source Embedding Models**

The quality of your embedding model is the single most important factor for your MAP score. Better embeddings mean more relevant documents are found in the initial search, which is the foundation for everything that follows.

**Can OSS Perform as Well?**
Yes, absolutely. In the domain of text embeddings, the open-source community is exceptionally strong. The current state-of-the-art models are often open-source and can be fine-tuned for specific domains, offering a significant advantage over general-purpose, proprietary APIs. Your current model, `snunlp/KR-SBERT-V40K-klueNLI-augSTS`, is a very solid open-source baseline, but there are more powerful options available.

**Recommended Models & Strategy:**

* **Tier 1: High-Performance Pre-trained Models**
    * **Recommendation:** Your first step should be to swap your current model with a top-tier, pre-trained Korean embedding model. Look for models that perform well on the **Ko-MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark)** leaderboard.
    * **Example Candidates:**
        * `Upstage's solar-1-mini-embedding-ko`
        * `BGE (BAAI General Embedding)` models that have been fine-tuned for Korean.
        * Other top-ranking models on Hugging Face specifically trained on diverse Korean datasets.
    * **Impact:** This is a low-effort, high-reward change. A better model will immediately improve the quality of your semantic search, which directly boosts the reranking performance in `hybrid_retrieve` and, therefore, your MAP score.

* **Tier 2: The Competitive Edge - Fine-tuning**
    * **Recommendation:** To achieve a top leaderboard score, you should fine-tune an open-source embedding model on your specific "scientific knowledge" domain. This is how you can create a model that is an expert at understanding the nuances of your 4,272 documents.
    * **Strategy:**
        1.  Use the **synthetic data generation** techniques we discussed previously (Inverse Cloze Task, Question Generation) to create a large dataset of `(query, relevant_passage)` pairs from your own documents.
        2.  Take a powerful pre-trained model from Tier 1 and fine-tune it on this synthetic dataset.
    * **Impact:** This is a high-effort, very high-reward strategy. A fine-tuned model will have a much deeper understanding of your specific corpus than any general-purpose model, giving you a significant competitive advantage.

### **2. Assessment of Open-Source Generation Models**

The generation model's primary job in this competition is to reliably perform the "routing" via tool-calling. Its secondary job is to generate the final answer.

**Can OSS Perform as Well?**
This is a more complex question with significant trade-offs. The answer is **yes, but it requires more effort and comes with performance costs.**

**Recommended Models & Strategy:**

* **Tier 1: High-Performance (Large Models)**
    * **Recommendation:** For the highest quality generation, you would use a state-of-the-art Korean open-source LLM.
    * **Example Candidates:**
        * **Upstage's SOLAR-10.7B:** A powerful, commercially viable model known for strong Korean performance.
        * **High-quality Llama 3 Fine-tunes:** Models like `EEVE-Korean-10.8B` or other leading Korean-tuned versions of Llama 3.
    * **Trade-offs:** These models are large. Running them efficiently requires significant VRAM and careful optimization.

* **Tier 2: Balanced Performance (Smaller, Quantized Models)**
    * **Recommendation:** To run on your local hardware (RTX 2090 24GB), you will need to use quantized versions of these models (e.g., GGUF, AWQ).
    * **Example Candidates:** 7B or 8B parameter models are the sweet spot for a 24GB card. A quantized version of a smaller SOLAR or a Korean Llama 3 8B model would be appropriate.
    * **Trade-offs:** Quantization can slightly reduce model performance. Inference will still be noticeably slower than a highly optimized API endpoint like OpenAI's.

### **Crucial Consideration: The Tool-Calling Gap**

This is the most important factor you must consider.

* **APIs are Specialized:** Models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` have been specifically and extensively trained to be excellent at **function/tool calling**. They are highly reliable at understanding when a tool is needed and generating the perfectly formatted JSON arguments. This is a key reason your current `RAGPipeline` works so well.
* **OSS is Generalist:** Most open-source models are not as proficient at reliable tool-calling out-of-the-box. Getting them to consistently produce the correct JSON for your `scientific_search` tool will require significant and expert-level **prompt engineering**. You would need to create very rigid prompt templates that guide the model to produce the exact output format, and it still might not be as reliable as the OpenAI API.

### **Final Recommendation: A Hybrid Strategy**



Given your goals, a hybrid strategy is the most logical path to success:

* **For the Competition (Maximize MAP Score):**
    1.  **Stick with the OpenAI API for the Generation/Tool-Calling layer.** It is fast, reliable, and perfectly suited for the evaluation script's 220 queries. Its reliability in deciding *when not to search* is critical to your score.
    2.  **Aggressively pursue an Open-Source Embedding Model.** Your primary focus should be on swapping in a better pre-trained embedding model (Tier 1) and, if time permits, fine-tuning it on synthetic data (Tier 2). This is the most direct way to improve your retrieval quality and climb the leaderboard.

* **For the LibreChat Application (Post-Competition):**
    1.  **Begin experimenting with Open-Source Generation Models.** Once the time pressure of the competition is gone, you can invest the effort into the advanced prompt engineering required to get reliable tool-calling from a local model.
    2.  **The Benefits:** For a real application, the advantages of OSS generation—cost control, data privacy, and customizability—become much more important and justify the additional engineering effort.
