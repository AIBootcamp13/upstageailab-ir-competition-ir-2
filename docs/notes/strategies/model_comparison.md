## Better Models Than Current (`snunlp/KR-SBERT-V40K-klueNLI-augSTS`)

**Potentially better options:**

1. **`jhgan/ko-sbert-nli`** - More recent, better NLI performance
2. **`BM-K/KoSimCSE-roberta-multitask`** - Uses SimCSE approach, often better for semantic similarity
3. **`klue/roberta-large` + sentence-transformers fine-tuning** - Custom fine-tuned version would likely outperform

**Recommendation**: Your current model is solid, but `BM-K/KoSimCSE-roberta-multitask` or a custom fine-tuned version would likely perform better.

## Dataset Questions

### Your Dataset Sufficiency
**Partially true** - Your 4,272 documents from MMLU/ARC Korean translations are good for your specific use case, but additional data could help:

### How Additional Data Would Help:

**For Retrieval:**
- **Domain-specific terminology**: More scientific Korean text would improve embedding quality for specialized terms
- **Query-document pairs**: Additional Q&A pairs would improve retrieval relevance
- **Hard negatives**: Documents that are topically similar but not relevant would improve discrimination

**For Generation:**
- **Answer formatting**: More examples of well-structured Korean scientific explanations
- **Reasoning patterns**: Additional examples of multi-step scientific reasoning in Korean

### Which Models/Phases Would Use Additional Data:

**Embedding Models (Retrieval Phase):**
- Fine-tune `snunlp/KR-SBERT-V40K-klueNLI-augSTS` or alternatives on:
  - Korean scientific paper abstracts
  - Korean Wikipedia science articles
  - Additional Korean Q&A datasets (KorQuAD, etc.)

**Generation Models:**
- Fine-tune generation models on:
  - Korean scientific explanations
  - Korean educational content
  - Your existing eval/validation sets expanded

**Reranking Models:**
- Train cross-encoders on:
  - Query-relevant document pairs
  - Query-irrelevant document pairs from your domain

**Recommendation**: Start with your current dataset, but consider adding Korean scientific Wikipedia articles or Korean educational content to improve domain coverage without losing focus on your specific task.
