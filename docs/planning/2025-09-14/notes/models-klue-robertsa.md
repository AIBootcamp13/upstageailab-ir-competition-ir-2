Based on your project's documentation and configuration, the **KLUE-RoBERTa** model (particularly KLUE-RoBERTa-large) would be most useful in the following parts of your RAG system for scientific question answering:

## 1. **Retrieval Component** (Information Retrieval)
Your project uses a hybrid retrieval approach with BM25 sparse search and dense vector search. KLUE-RoBERTa can enhance this in two key ways:

- **Semantic Search**: Generate dense vector embeddings for documents and queries to perform semantic similarity search, finding relevant content even when different words express the same concepts
- **Reranking**: After initial BM25 retrieval, use KLUE-RoBERTa to rerank results based on deep semantic understanding rather than just keyword matching

## 2. **Generation Component** (Question Answering)
For the Q&A aspect of your scientific system:

- **Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC)**: Fine-tune KLUE-RoBERTa on your scientific documents to extract precise answers from passages
- **Relation Extraction (RE)**: Identify complex relationships between scientific entities (e.g., "protein X interacts with disease Y")

## Current Usage in Your Project
Your configuration currently uses `snunlp/KR-SBERT-V40K-klueNLI-augSTS` (a KLUE-based SBERT model) for embeddings, which serves the semantic search purpose. KLUE-RoBERTa would be complementary - potentially more powerful for MRC and RE tasks if you expand beyond basic retrieval.

## When KLUE-RoBERTa is Most Valuable
- If your scientific documents contain Korean text (KLUE models excel at Korean language understanding)
- For advanced Q&A requiring reading comprehension beyond simple retrieval
- When you need to extract structured relationships from unstructured scientific text

The model would fit into your modular architecture through the `generation/` module (as an alternative to OpenAI/Ollama) or as an enhanced retrieval component.
